# Sorting algorythms written in C++

I was bored so i decided to give myself a task of writing 4 sorting algorythms ranging from very easy to intermediate with c++ pointers. I hope it is memory safe lol.

1. [quick sort](./src/quick.cpp)
1. [merge sort](./src/merge.cpp)
1. [bubble sort](./src/bubble.cpp)
1. [insert sort](./src/insert.cpp)

## Usage

All of the code is in [./src](./src)
```bash
cat src/*
```

## 🛠 Skills
All of those can sort arrays B)
